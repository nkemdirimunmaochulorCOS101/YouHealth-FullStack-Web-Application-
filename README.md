# YouHealth-Web-Application-Frontend
This is the frontend code for my YouHealth Web Application for elderly users and medical practitioners which allows them to make appointments, have virtual consultation and track medicals. I uses HTML for the structure of the code, Tailwind CSS for styling and JavaScript for functionality.
